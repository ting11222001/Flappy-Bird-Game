## How to Play

Once you've completed the installation steps, dive right into the fun! You'll find yourself immersed in the Flappy Bird game directly within the application window. Just tap the spacebar to keep the bird flapping and skillfully navigating through the maze of pipes.

But remember, it's not just about flapping away! You'll need to steer clear of the pipes and stay within the window's borders. Each time you successfully pass through a pair of pipes, you'll earn yourself an extra point on your score. Keep going to see how high you can fly!
